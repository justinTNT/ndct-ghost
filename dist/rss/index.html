This is an attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff, and identify the significant detail from the mounting evidence and whirling accusations.</p><h2 id="tldr">TL/DR</h2><p>Natasha Fyles, the ALP Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, has leapt from one instance of corrupt and dishonest behaviour to another - each of which would be grounds for resignation and potential prosecution in any other jurisdiction. Along the way, she has dragged the members of her cabinet into blatant deliberate deception of the public.</p><h2 id="when-did-history-begin">When did history begin?</h2><p>The current crisis in Palestine has launched a thousand bad-takes that are best met with the illustrative rhetorical. But here we&apos;ll take it literally. </p><p>Of course, the ugly history of industrial domination of the NT began with colonisation. </p><p>But I&apos;m no historian, so I&apos;ll leave it to others to start the story there.</p><p>In another, more focused way, we might begin with the highly contentious and strongly opposed Philips Petroleum gas plant at Wickham Point. I was around for the huge campaign by Save Darwin Harbour, and I could tell the story that way. It entails the granting, then revocation, of planning scheme protections on Middle Arm, now the target of a major gas and petro-chemical industrial development precinct. But although those crimes against nature are plastered in the ALP logo, none of our current parliamentarians were on board then.</p><p>To many observers, the story of unprecedented dishonesty and corruption around fossil fuel industrialisation of the NT begins with the former Gunner administration and the Territory Economic Reconstruction Committee. </p><p>I don&apos;t necessarily agree, but I might start there and explain why.</p><h2 id="corrupt-by-design">Corrupt by Design</h2><p>Elsewhere, I&apos;ve written about the TERC&apos;s final report, and explored accusations laid against the lead authors - former NT ALP Chief Minister turned oil &amp; gas consultant Paul Henderson, and former born &amp; bred local turned petrochemical exec - and Trump adviser - Andrew Liveris. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-06-at-11.51.11-pm.png" class="kg-image" alt="Fyles fouls" loading="lazy" width="1156" height="600" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-06-at-11.51.11-pm.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-06-at-11.51.11-pm.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-06-at-11.51.11-pm.png 1156w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As I described <a href="https://nowdochemtrails.net/strategy/">here</a>; </p><blockquote>some peeps worry over Mr Henderson&#x2019;s ... ties to the fossil fuel industry distorts his role on the Commission: that he might be more interested in setting up opportunities for his fossil mates than developing an economy for Territorians;</blockquote><blockquote>But clearly, that decision was made before he was engaged.</blockquote><blockquote>In fact, the Commission were literally given instructions, titled &#x2018;Operation Rebound&#x2019;, which were quite specific in assuring a role for gas (maliciously mislabeled as &#x2018;clean energy&#x2019;).</blockquote><p>Corruption is the dishonest abuse of power by individuals in authority for personal interests. But that&apos;s not what happened with the TERC. Instead, we find the abuse of power by individuals in the Committee was baked into its design. Chief Minister Michael Gunner had followed the lead of former Prime Minister Scott Morrison, and declared a program for a &apos;gas fired recovery.&apos; </p><p>Messrs Henderson and Liveris were invited, in fact instructed, to pursue opportunities for their fossil fuel interests in the name of &apos;building back&apos; the NT economy as the nation sought to return to work after the disruption of covid lockdowns. It&apos;s not corruption of that abuse was always intended. </p><p>dirty? yes. anti-democratic? somewhat. but corrupt? dishonest? no. This was more like the respectable CLP style of proudly owning their worst intentions.</p><h2 id="post-truth-petrochemistry">post-truth petrochemistry</h2><p>The real starting point of this NT ALP government&apos;s total abandonment of the electorate really came with the referral of plans for an unprecedented project to build a massive new gas industry hub at Middle Arm.</p><p>Community advocates quite understandably seized upon components of this ambitious plan: the intention to invite tennants for gas-fueled production plants of petrochemicals including amonia, urea, ethylene, methanol and so-called &apos;clean&apos; petroleum. In addition to the environmental harm such tennants would present, advocates warned about the harm to human health, particularly on the nearby suburbs of Palmerston. Local paediatricians and international experts alike warned of impacts including a population wide increase in childhood cancers.</p><p>And that&apos;s when it got messy. In November 2022, Chief Minister Fyles indignantly denied that the plans for Middle Arm included petrochemicals. Government websites were scrubbed of the word &apos;petrochemical&apos; and the Chief went on to accuse environmental advocates of lying.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/12/no-petrochems.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Fyles fouls" loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/no-petrochems.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/12/no-petrochems.jpeg 640w"></figure><p>but of course the evidence was everywhere. &#xA0;</p><p>As this <a href="https://darwin.news/post-truth-petrochemistry/">darwin.news article</a> describes,</p><blockquote>Records and documents of other parties to the MAD Precinct plan still feature the &apos;petrochemical&apos; label.</blockquote><p>These included various EPA documents, the TERC progress report, and the NT investment commissioner. </p><p>The Middle Arm business case submitted to Infrastructure Australia; evidence by CEO of Tamboran to a senate inquiry; the &apos;enabling infrastructure&apos; video submitted by NT Government to the feds; fact sheets; commissioned reports - all provide various details of firm plans for petrochemical industries sited at Middle Arm</p><p>To this day, the Chief Minister continues to maintain the charade, which is - hilarious, but also disturbing for anyone who values democracy.</p><p>dirty? yes. anti-democratic? yes. dishonest? yes. </p><p>but corrupt?</p><p>Well, that depends. A cynic might suggest that this is just the new style of politics, as pioneered and proven by former (and possibly future?) president Trump. Those four years showed just how much can be achieved by forcefully asserting falsehood. If this is what democracy is about <em>(hint: it&apos;s not)</em>, then maybe it&apos;s not corrupt for political leaders to mislead so brazenly.</p><h2 id="chiefs-shares">Chief&apos;s shares</h2><p>12 months later, news broke that the Chief Minister had failed to disclose ownership of shares in Woodside, a touted tennant of the Middle Arm Development (MAD) precinct.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-06-at-11.59.02-pm---dropshadow.png" class="kg-image" alt="Fyles fouls" loading="lazy" width="1586" height="1262" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-06-at-11.59.02-pm---dropshadow.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-06-at-11.59.02-pm---dropshadow.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-06-at-11.59.02-pm---dropshadow.png 1586w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://ntindependent.com.au/chief-ministers-private-shares-in-major-gas-company-revealed/">https://ntindependent.com.au/chief-ministers-private-shares-in-major-gas-company-revealed/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The story first appeared on NT Independent, a web-only publication that successive NT Chief Ministers have refused to recognise as legitimate news media. It was soon picked up by other outlets, and the Chief delivered a range of excuses, delaying the obvious response of divesting.</p><p>Whereas the other outlets eventually tired of the story, NT Independent was like a dog with a bone, prosecuting a new angle nearly every day for over a week. Ms Fyles did herself no favours, choosing to argue the point from various directions before eventually, finally, doing the obvious thing she should have done years ago and divesting the small shareholding at the centre of conflict-of-interest claims.</p><p>dirty? more like messy. anti-democratic? meh. dishonest? well, somewhat. corrupt? hardly.</p><p>The Chief&apos;s handling of this issue did engage some deception and misdirection. Where she should have immediately relinquished the small holdings in Woodside, she wasted time and squandered credibility on dishonestly reframing the situation as a non-issue. Her response probably had the utility of allowing those who wanted to support labor to cling on to specious detail in order to believe she had done nothing wrong: the shares were a gift from her grandmother; it was only 159 shares, valued at little more than $5000; they were originally Rio shares, which transitioned to Woodside shares at a later date; she did eventually declare them (albeit later than she should have); she did eventually divest (but not without a lot of media pressure).</p><p>Of course, none of these details counters the fact that the Chief Minister, and her colleagues, exhibited disregard for standards regarding declaration and divestment of conflict of interest. But ultimately, the incident was more illustrative than material. Fyles&apos; fumbling of a meager shareholding showed us that the NT still does not have adequate controls to adequately discourage any more substantial conflict of interest.</p><h2 id="more-liesemissions-offsets">More lies - emissions offsets</h2><p>On 4th December, it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/04/net-zero-policy-new-gas-projects-abandoned-industry-objections?fbclid=IwAR1hZohQ4G3UyCBNd26JxIve5Rfdvs5BQom10u4ik7LNi9Tr9vCGAWWYUe4">The Guardian</a> who found evidence of what many suspected.

In fact, labor surprised everyone by adopting the CLP&apos;s &apos;tough talking&apos; approach to the uncomfortable realities of homeless people who come to Darwin from the wide catchment of poorly serviced remote communities in the Top End. They promised mandatory rehabilitation for alcohol-related crime, and apparently surprised partner organisations who they declared would help impose &apos;standards&apos; on itinerant visitors.</p><p>This proved outrageously successful for their campaign. The CLP leader, Denis Burke (accurately) accused them of trying to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-06-08/clp-accuses-labor-of-chasing-redneck-vote/1588522">steal his red neck voters</a>. His voters didn&apos;t take kindly to being labelled as such, and he was left effectively, and obviously, out-manouevered. The labor party&apos;s logic was that breaking a few eggs (endorsing the gutter politics of slandering homeless Indigenous people) is the price of a good omelette (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20638335">decimating the old guard</a> of the CLP).</p><p>On the left, labor took a more measured approach. But campaigning during the election period by a number of <a href="www.wwf.org.au/ArticleDocuments/360/pub-developing-the-territory-nt-election-2005-1apr05.pdf.aspx">environment groups</a> highlighted concerns about land and water management in the Daly River catchment.

So although labor hadn&apos;t brought any policy or preparation targeting that constituency, in the final hours they ramped it up.</p><h3 id="no-uranium">No uranium</h3><p>On the Friday before polling day, Chief Minister Clare Martin made a surprise declaration: no more uranium mining.</p><p>It was a surprise, because until that moment, uranium mining had not been raised. The vague threat of a nuclear waste dump had been floated by the feds a week out from the poll, but we were still a while away from the uranium rush that was to gather pace over the following year. Uranium mining was just not on the political landscape. And although the announcement was consistent with federal ALP policy at the time, it wasn&apos;t NT policy.</p><p>That position didn&apos;t hold long - the re-elected labor government was issuing exploration licenses to uranium miners just two weeks later, and the fact <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-07-29/martin-open-to-change-over-uranium-mining-policy/2069190">it was abandoned</a> in a couple of months illustrates the spirit in which Ms Martin&apos;s announcement was made.

These moves risked replicating the errors of the Murray Darling Basin in a region that notoriously suffers an annual drought; the Dry Season. A certain Controller of Water was heard to quip that maybe we needed to make those mistakes to qualify for the federal remediation funding...</p><p>Despite their role in engineering the threat, labor effortlessly pivoted, declaring that only they could be trusted to wisely manage the risks posed by new agricultural development.

They say this, and other perceived ties to the fossil fuel industry, distorts his role on the Commission: that he might be more interested in setting up opportunities for his fossil mates than developing an economy for Territorians;</p><p>But clearly, that decision was made before he was engaged.</p><p>In fact, the Commission were literally given instructions, titled &#x2018;Operation Rebound&#x2019;, which were quite specific in assuring a role for gas (maliciously mislabeled as &#x2018;clean energy&#x2019;).</p><p>Gunner&#x2019;s announcement of the TERC had him very enthusiastic that gas would feature in the new commission&#x2019;s advice. and before that, Scumo had already similarly appointed fossil industry big wig (and former Territorian) Andrew Liveris to chart a gas-led recovery for the nation. </p><p>So Mr Henderson can&#x2019;t be accused of perverting the design: he&#x2019;s personifying it.He&#x2019;s not responsible for the bias to gas: just complicit.</p><p>&#x2018;gas shill&#x2019;? Sure. <br>but I&#x2019;m far more annoyed at his proven failure at economic management.</p><p>as the Report readily identifies: &#xA0;Inpex was a massive fossil fuel project which Mr Henderson took credit for enticing to the Territory (from the NW shelf) with promises of less government interference. &#xA0;(Someone give that man a medal!)</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2021/07/EzeL__fVUAIOqT9.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Some real locals were priced out of town during construction, leaving those who rode it out to suffer an entirely unmanaged crash.</p><p>From his time as Resource Minister ushering the foreign gas company in, to his two terms as Chief overseeing (without interfering with) the boom, Mr Henderson neglected to plan for the inevitable.</p><p>After dredging our Living Harbour, and falling short on promises of Traineeships and Apprenticeships for locals, the least he could&#x2019;ve done was to look out for the many locals who were sticking it out, rather than benefiting from what we were assured was a once-in-a-lifetime economic opportunity.</p><p>By the time we hit the wall without a seatbelt, Adam Giles was driving, and he copped stick for it (fair enough, he didn&#x2019;t seem to have any good ideas). But it was Mr Henderson who set it up, and presided over the boom: the fact that the &#x2018;opportunity&#x2019; of Inpex ended up harming our economy is on him.</p><p>And while I don&#x2019;t really hold him responsible for the content or direction of this Report, I&#x2019;m certain his is not the kind of mind we need to address economic rejuvenation. I really resent that this appointment, while of absolutely zero value to Territorians, will have been of benefit to furthering his post-parliamentary career.</p><p>But let&#x2019;s have a quick look at the turd the TERC dropped. In fact, for starters, let&#x2019;s carefully consider the first sentence. Which, as I already warned, is BATSHIT insane.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2021/07/EzeOR9yVcAMmH2W.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Now hang on: we&#x2019;ve recently been through the wild economic growth of Inpex, and not all enjoyed higher living standards as a result. When rents kept rising, some long term locals had to leave Darwin&#x2019;s unaffordable market - either go bush, or go interstate.</p><p>Some people got good salaries for a while - but not everyone; certainly not all Territorians. Some who did spent silly, and then had to sell the new boat when the job was gone. Even this Report admits the economy was not well after the crash. <br><br>Yet the Report aspires to an even higher growth rate (see Figure 2). Locals would be understandably hesitant to subscribe to the assumption that churning more wealth through the economy would meet our primary need from economic rejuvenation: employment opportunities.</p><p>Now, its important to note that this $40b aspiration is ridiculously fantastical; not so much an ambition as the suspension of rational belief. And I guess in some ways it can be useful to fantasise.</p><p>But this isnt presented as a basis for discussing how we want the economy to benefit us as it grows; what kind of jobs we want our economy to enable for us, what kind of lessons we want to take from pandemic, what new or increased needs we want to prioritise.</p><p>No, this Report asserts the well disproven b0rken assumption that growth - increasing the rate at which wealth is passing through the economy - trumps all other economic measurements and outcomes.</p><p>By their own admission,</p><p>&#x201C;the Commission focused only on the industries and the enabling factors most likely to significantly shift the economic curve upwards&#x201D;</p><p>Which economic curve? Not the jobs curve. They mean growth. <br><br>The Commission were given a target for that one economic parameter, and now they&#x2019;ve shared some (very familiar and predictable) declarations on what actions could contribute to that target.</p><p>Will their suggestions provide the kind of employment opportunities local people might appreciate?</p><p>Or risk the kind of volatile rents that might make our towns unwelcoming to locals? If these suggestions are good for &#x2018;growth&#x2019;, are they good for Territorians?</p><p>Recommendation is made for a Territory Careers Pathway, but it&#x2019;s cart-before-horse: this idea comes after they&#x2019;ve chosen which opportunities to boost, which in turn comes from their assumptions about how to meet the (fantasy) growth target. Instead of reconstructing the economy to meet our needs, they want to plug Territorians into their idea of a boom economy</p><p></p><p>An appropriate approach to post-covid economic rejuvenation would have:</p><ul><li>identified those features of the NT economy most harmed by pandemic shutdown;</li><li>described new opportunities anticipated for a post-pandemic economy; </li><li>considered what shape of economy territorians want;</li></ul><p>But no. This Report doesn&apos;t even explore the impact of global economic shutdown on the proposals it champions: It&#x2019;s all about &#x2018;back to business&#x2019;, on the basis of pre-covid settings. No consideration that the board may have shifted in the meantime, and certainly no appetite for taking a fresh look at past assumptions.</p><p></p><p>&#x2018;But wait!&#x2019; I hear, &#x2018;thare&#x2019;s a baby in that frack-fluid bathwater!&#x2019;</p><p>So OK, my butterfly-chasing optimist friends, let&#x2019;s acknowledge the glitter on this turd.</p><p>It&#x2019;s this, remarkably sensible but nonetheless still unfamiliar news to governments:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2021/07/EzeRRP3UUAEVNFC.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>I imagine that this clear, sensible and welcome recommendation will get considerable resucitation over the remainder of the Gunner regime&#x2019;s time. Both Territory and Federal labor parties eschew interim carbon emissions reduction targets, and in fact Territory Labor have declared an intent to grow the NT&#x2019;s emissions as high as they will until 2030.</p><p>The rarity value of this common-sense recommendation will save the TERC Final Report from getting shredded. Gunner etal are doomed to be reminded that they are committed to ignoring this good advice.</p><p></p><p>Readers are now invited to reflect on the integrity of this offering, given that it&#x2019;s entirely incompatible with recommendations for methane mining, LNG production, gas industry services, more gas power, LNG to hydrogen, gas, gas and more gas. Why would the Commission present diametric recommendations? Which do we think will win prioritisation?</p><p>And tho the word &#x2018;renewable&#x2019; is liberally sprinkled throughout the report, thare is no specific recommendation to support the rise of renewable industries, merely acknowledgement of this inevitability: and the authors cant resist accompanying almost every reference to renewables with the misnomer &#x2018;low emissions technology&#x2019;, by which they mean gas. Go figure.</p><p>Despite the structural inadequacy of the Commission&#x2019;s approach (ie actively pursuing growth at the expense of more meaningful objectives) there are some good recommendations. Such as moving remote communities off diesel, and renewed investment in community housing. These are Good Things! Yep let&#x2019;s do that.</p><p>The Commission&#x2019;s work does not provide a strategy or a plan; but a justification for mistakes others have already chosen for us. The focus is not on how to rejuvenate and restructure our economy, but using the circumstances of pandemic decline to justify a full-boar tilt at certain high stakes industries.</p><p>I suspect the agenda for this project is defined by their recommendations for government to:</p><ul><li>Deliver roads;</li><li>&#x2018;Modernise&#x2019; water regulation;</li><li>Provide clarity / certainty / guidance on land access (noting, pastoral, aboriginal land and sacred sites)</li><li>review legislation and regulation, addressing any complexity, clarity and timeframe issues for industry</li><li>improve regulatory efficiency, including national environment laws</li></ul><p></p><p>And if that sounds like a grab bag of wishes from the fracking industry, thankyou for your attention.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[senate estimates hearings hear estimates of 39Mtpa]]></title><description><![CDATA[the Commonwealth would merely advise the NT on how they might pursue offsets for this huge carbon burden of fracking]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/senate-estimates-hearings-hear-estimates-of-39mtpa/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">63d73436db91bd4b2690195c</guid><category><![CDATA[fracking]]></category><category><![CDATA[gas]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Billy Mason]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2020 14:23:31 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2020/03/hotair.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2020/03/hotair.jpg" alt="senate estimates hearings hear estimates of 39Mtpa"><p>This week&apos;s appearance of representatives of the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources put some meat on the bones of recent ABC reporting over the vastly under-estimated emissions anticipated from fracking the Beetaloo Basin.

The reason I&apos;m asking is that the department has advised the minister that between 39 and 117 million tonnes of emissions would be released each and every year through the Beetaloo gas project. The Northern Territory government wants to offset it. You found it a bit challenging to say that we could do better than 20 million. You wouldn&apos;t give me an answer on whether we could reach 120 million. That&apos;s potentially what the Beetaloo gas project could be releasing every year. If it needed to be abated as the NT government insists, is that feasible?</p><p>Ms Evans <strong>:</strong> I just need to correct a couple of things that you have said. You said that it was our briefing to the minister that contained the reference to the 117 million tonnes.</p><p><a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22handbook%2Fallmps%2F192970%22;querytype=;rec=0"><strong>Senator WATERS:</strong> </a>Is that not correct?</p><p>Ms Evans <strong>:</strong> That&apos;s not correct. That figure is a reference in a meeting, which has been recorded. The reference was made by a Northern Territory government official. We understand that they were referring to a particular number that is in the Senate inquiry into hydraulic fracturing in the Northern Territory. The number is not a comparable number to anything we would use to measure Australia&apos;s emissions or report on in terms of our target.</p><p><a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22handbook%2Fallmps%2F192970%22;querytype=;rec=0"><strong>Senator WATERS:</strong> </a>Why not?</p><p>Ms Evans <strong>:</strong> For a number of reasons. The first is that that number, which comes from the report, is a number that reflects both emissions in Australia, which are ones that we would be using to refer to our target, and emissions associated with gas that might be burned overseas.</p><p><a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22handbook%2Fallmps%2F192970%22;querytype=;rec=0"><strong>Senator WATERS:</strong> </a>Are you saying that the 117 million includes scope 3?</p><p>Ms Evans <strong>:</strong> That&apos;s correct.

So we use a 100-year global warming potential. These things are set out in specific guidelines. Actually, the 39 tonnes is the one at that scale that is consistent with the way we would report our emissions or our emissions towards our target in Australia. The 117 is simply another characterisation of that which uses a number of assumptions that are entirely inconsistent with the way we calculate our inventory.</p><p><a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22handbook%2Fallmps%2F192970%22;querytype=;rec=0"><strong>Senator WATERS:</strong> </a>Based on the normal methodology that you would use, you would say that it&apos;s more like 39 million tonnes a year, which is scope 1 and 2 in 100 years?</p><p>Ms Evans <strong>:</strong> That is the figure that was in the hydraulic fracturing in the Northern Territory report.

Concerns about the local risk to precious finite water resources from fracking, or the un-addressed burden of fugitive methane emissions from existing gas plants, are carelessly dismissed as a small price to pay for producing a fuel that is (slightly?) cleaner than coal, and presents the amorphous value of a Transition Fuel. </p><p>But when it comes to nurturing the emergent domestic solar industry, past investment in gas power is the basis of arguments for caution. Those investors brave enough to dream big are reminded that the Territory&apos;s already paid for another 15 years of fuel for our gas-fired power stations. Those sensible enough to pitch a medium-scale grid connected solar plant are obstructed with unrealistic demands from the grid operator, including unfeasible performance standards in forecasting output. New solar players are also told they need to provide large on-site battery infrastructure, which some say unfairly taxes newcomers for the failure of the NT&apos;s sole power provider to adequately plan for and invest in a distributed energy future.</p><blockquote>How can gas be a transitional fuel when we sell it, but such an obstacle at home?

Proponents make <a href="https://www.shale-gas.com.au/environment/cleaner-energy/">big claims</a> for the carbon savings of gas over coal, but fall short on two counts. First, the lack of any international framework within which to assess that new gas has actually displaced pre-existing dirtier coal; and secondly, the growing evidence of previously un-measured and under-estimated fugitive emissions from gas mining and processing. Some analysts warn that the un-accounted and <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/11/15/3633615.htm">under-accounted</a> <a href="https://www.livescience.com/52715-natural-gas-not-as-clean-as-people-think.html">carbon burden of gas</a> balloon the claimed 33% less pollution to approach <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/03/booming-lng-industry-could-be-as-bad-for-climate-as-coal-experts-warn">equivalence</a>.</p><blockquote>Sure, natural gas burns cleaner than coal. But that&apos;s only part of the story; and methane emissions along the fuel chain take some of the shine off the industry&apos;s rosy promises.</blockquote><p>Even allowing that the full life-cycle carbon burden of NT gas may be less than that of coal, there&apos;s no evidence that it has - or ever will - actually displaced coal. Instead, it seems that NT gas - both current off-shore drilling via Darwin LNG plants, or proposed on-shore fracking for shale gas - is going to clients who are growing consumption of all dirty fuels. </p><p>Our current big LNG projects - the Inpex <a href="https://www.santos.com/media-centre/announcements/bayu-undan-lng-sales-contract-executed/">Icthyus</a> project, and ConnocoPhillips&apos; <a href="https://www.santos.com/media-centre/announcements/bayu-undan-lng-sales-contract-executed/">Bayu Undan</a>, are sending the full complement of gas to <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/japan/">Japan</a>, where <a href="http://www.nocoaljapan.org/the-problem/coal-expansion-in-japan/">new coal plants</a> are still being built. The fracking hopefuls are all looking to export, and although some of those export markets feature declining coal consumption, the uptake in dirty gas outpaces the decline in dirty coal, and none have a credible plan for transitioning beyond these dirty fuels to clean renewable energy alternatives. So even where gas is facilitating less reliance on coal, it is not being done within a framework of reducing emissions or transition to renewables.</p><h3 id="so-its-unsurprising-that-gas-isn-t-helping-the-nt-pursue-our-official-target-of-50-renewable-energy-by-2030">So its unsurprising that gas isn&apos;t helping the NT pursue our official target of 50% renewable energy by 2030</h3><p><br>Another selling point of the &apos;transition&apos; capacity of gas is that it can pair well with renewables. The ability of gas power plants to run at low capacity, then spin up to match short-falls in intermittent supply, makes a coordinated grid incorporating existing gas and new renewable generation a useful match.</p><p>Or so the story goes. Here in Darwin, the government-owned entities that run the gas, and operate the grid, don&apos;t share enthusiasm for this transitional potential. Instead, they require connection agreements for new renewable projects to commit to high frequency forecasting, backed by significant penalties for non compliance. Instead of moderating gas to facilitate cleaner generation, this mob seem more interested in maximising gas consumption, to minimise the risk of the spectacularly bad &apos;<a href="https://www.alicespringsnews.com.au/2017/11/09/gas-deal-they-cant-blame-giles-for-this-one/">take-or-pay</a>&apos; deal.

I&apos;ll let you connect the dots...</p><h2 id="gas-solar">gas -&gt; solar</h2><p>The initial premise is incorrect. Gas is no more a transition fuel for our export markets than it has been for the NT. But that doesn&apos;t mean we should resign ourselves to fatalism that dictates our past investments in gas justify delaying solar innovation. The challenge for the Territory is as it remains for the world: to cut ties to the polluting energy fuels of the past, to make way for cleaner, cheaper sustainable solutions.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Territory declined]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last week, the NT  Chief Minister was unrecognisably pleased to announce agreement for a NAIF loan to build ship-lift infrastructure in Darwin. ]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/territory-declined/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">63d73436db91bd4b26901958</guid><category><![CDATA[chemtrails]]></category><category><![CDATA[economy]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Billy Mason]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2019 03:29:26 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2019/12/lift-boat-capsizes-gulf-of-mexico-800x450.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2019/12/lift-boat-capsizes-gulf-of-mexico-800x450.jpg" alt="Territory declined"><p>Last week, the NT &#xA0;Chief Minister was <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-10/northern-territory-government-naif-grant-ship-lift/11784690">unrecognisably pleased</a> to announce agreement for a NAIF loan to build ship-lift infrastructure in Darwin.

This visualisation, from the NT Department of Treasury and Finance website, says a lot: at the time when the massive Inpex LNG project is celebrating their export volumes, the rest of us are doing worse than we were a year ago - and investment for the future is way down.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2019/12/economic-growth.png" class="kg-image" alt="Territory declined" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Attempts to up-sell the economic potential of on-shore gas exploitation have had to be moderated with real-talk acknowledging long latency, demands for exploration <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/funding-for-nt-gas-doesn-t-help-short-term-manufacturers-20190403-p51a88">stimulus</a> and uncertain viability. At the other end of the energy industry spectrum, the SunCable solar project is welcome activity, but one that has advanced (so far) independently of government.

Billed as the largest such facility in Australia, Mr Gunner rightly describes it as &quot;<em>a strategic investment which will open up the investment potential of the region</em>&quot;</p><blockquote>Depending who&apos;s asking, there may also be some work for the facility by visiting foreign forces, although the USA&apos;s Merchant Marine Act 1920, commonly referred to as the Jones Act, muddies the waters there: requiring American workers for American ships. Just like their Independence, this one looks like a good idea that we should try here in Australia.</blockquote><p>It sure looks like good economic news: some jobs and activity in the short term that will open up further opportunities once operational. And that&apos;s a welcome story, given the state of the Territory economy.</p><h2 id="territory-in-decline">territory in decline</h2><p>A useful appreciation of the state of the economy is commonly obscured by the political blame game. Opponents of the labor government will lazily put it all at the feet of Michael Gunner, while the Chief (equally disingenuous) blames the <a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/when-the-circus-runs-the-town-the-nts-scandal-plagued-country-liberal-party-government/news-story/28b37ecd03375ef5c6620a80588b6ffa">mess</a> left by his predecessors. </p><p>Neither simple explanation feels quite right: our current woes can&apos;t all be pinned on one questionable <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-13/darwin-turf-club-tender-critism-prompts-new-rules/11511266">grandstand</a> build, or a squandered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/04/nt-chief-minister-refuses-to-disclose-darwin-port-sale-details">port sale</a>. But just how far back in history do we need to look to understand how we got here? Standard procedure when you find yourself in a crazy situation is to look back to the last sane moment you remember, and for the NT, that&apos;d have to be before Inpex came to town.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2019/12/41949559651_c38ed5c4e1_b.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Territory declined" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The Inpex LNG plant : they assured the public it wouldn&apos;t be visible.</figcaption></figure><p>The Territory &apos;won&apos; the Inpex LNG plant with promises of less red tape than the initial target of WA - weasel words for a lower standard of regulation. The win was announced in 2008, but approvals took another 2 years, and it wasn&apos;t until 2012 that a final investment decision was made. The project threatened to be a &apos;game-changer&apos;, the biggest single project Darwin would ever see, growing the economy 5% each year over the construction period. The newspaper talked of a $50b bonanza, which in a matter of weeks had calmed down to $33b - what&apos;s a few billions between friends: &#xA0;if the predictions weren&apos;t precisely accurate, they captured the vibe. This was boomtime.</p><p>Anyone could&apos;ve predicted the bust. </p><p>In fact many did. Local unionists and Traditional Owners joined forces to try to ensure that, if nothing else, some young locals would get <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/14/indigenous-workers-on-inpex-project-given-falsified-certificates-say-trainees">apprenticeships</a> and solid employment experience during the construction phase. If any of our politicians had tried half as hard to prepare for the inevitable post-boom decline, we&apos;d undoubtedly be in a much better position today.</p><p>So just what is that position? and how does it compare to the pre-boom economy?</p><blockquote>disclaimer: I&apos;m just a simple conspiracy theorist. I&apos;m not afraid of numbers but I&apos;m not trained in finance, so claim no expertise: &#xA0;just quoting treasury </blockquote><p><strong>Growth</strong> is a tricky one. Many of us would have had that conversation by now; we can see that there&apos;s been a lot of economic activity (construction) in and around our town; but we sure as hoop didn&apos;t get a piece of it. The NT economy is of course larger now than it ever has been. So why do some of us feel worse off?</p><p>Let&apos;s start by looking at growth per-capita.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2019/12/per-cap-gsp.png" class="kg-image" alt="Territory declined" loading="lazy"><figcaption>the Inpex effect is strong in this one...</figcaption></figure><p>That was a huge peak during construction, but it&apos;s well and truly history: GSP per capita is almost back where it was before NT Gov and Inpex started courting.</p><p>If we look at wages, the problem becomes clearer:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2019/12/gsp-vs-compo.png" class="kg-image" alt="Territory declined" loading="lazy"></figure><p>after the significant peak in wages growth at the start of the Inpex construction period, wage growth has steadily slowed, until this past financial year, where wages have fallen (almost -2%). Most of us know a mate who made bad financial decisions based on what they were earning 7 years ago. I saw a few new boats begrudgingly offloaded around the 2016 mark. When individuals suffer bad personal financial decisions like that, its unfortunate for them and their families; when governments do it, its a dereliction of responsibility.</p><p>New boats aside, for most of us, the real point of wages is to meet the <strong>costs of living</strong>. And that&apos;s where the story&apos;s worst. On this measure, the benefits of the boom were moderated, while the impact of the decline is pronounced. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2019/12/wpi.png" class="kg-image" alt="Territory declined" loading="lazy"></figure><p>and I think this describes the failure that is Inpex. They&apos;ve had their way with our living harbour, which drove a lot of other construction activity, while diminishing the capacity of local workers to meet our costs of living.</p><p>There&apos;s a couple of other basic measurements to call out. I won&apos;t do housing, because I think it&apos;s confusing. It was infuriating to see real locals priced out of town by high rents and unaffordable property prices. And I guess it must be frustrating if you need to leave now but can&apos;t afford to sell at current prices. But I&apos;m not going to discuss the housing market pre and post Inpex, cos I&apos;m not confident about interpreting the information correctly. </p><p>But this, I can read:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2019/12/employment.png" class="kg-image" alt="Territory declined" loading="lazy"></figure><p>That big dip in employment does correspond with population decline, which moderates it somewhat - and the NT unemployment rate is about the national average. But NT is not a great place to be unemployed (or young, or old, or sick, etc) and this one graph represents real pain for Territorians. I know a few blokes recently out of work, and having a real tough time at it. Where the wage price index shows that workers need to economise to get through each month, that growing proportion of unemployed have the impossible mission of meeting rising costs with subsistency welfare that remains pegged well below the poverty line.</p><h2 id="sharing-the-blame">sharing the blame</h2><p>Clearly, the Territory&apos;s current predicament comes from an arc that extends from the Inpex agreement, ten years ago. While Gunner&apos;s mob haven&apos;t covered themselves in glory, failing to conform to their own budget or maintain staffing caps, its ridiculous to hold them entirely accountable. But its just as wrong-headed to pin it all on the disgraced Giles government. Some have blamed the CLP for allowing the budget to go into deficit, and debt to grow, at a time when they might have been safeguarding the economy. But Giles was just one among the past five Chiefs have held the gate open to the Inpex project without any discernable plan to prepare us for this, the inevitable post-construction decline.</p><p>If I had to pick a scape goat, it&apos;d be Paul Henderson. He was Chief when the deal was formalised, making him best placed to plan for the present.
